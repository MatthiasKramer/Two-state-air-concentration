# Two-state-air-concentration
This repository provides data and code for the two-state air concentration convolution presented in [Kramer and Valero](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2023.440) (2023, JFM). The convolution principle is exemplified based on seminal data of [Straub and Anderson](https://doi.org/10.1061/JYCEAJ.0000261) (1958)

**Run the code**

To run the code, download the complete folder and execute TWOSTATEv10.mat. 

**Free parameters**

The two-state convolution contains several free parameters that may have to be adjusted for other datasets:

-L44: ystar is evaluated based on Fig. 4d in [Kramer and Valero](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2023.440 (2023); note that this might not be a unique solution and ystar might have to be adjusted.

-L48: delta is computed empirically, as per Fig. 4c in [Kramer and Valero](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2023.440 (2023). Please estimate delta from velocity measurements, if available.

-L55: overlap determines the number of points used for fitting. This will only slightly change results, but may be worthwhile to adjust.

-L62: sigmastar is determined as (0.1 to 0.2)*delta.
